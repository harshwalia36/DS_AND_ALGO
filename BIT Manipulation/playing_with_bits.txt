// To find the position  of the most significant set bit .
    int k = (int)(log2(n)); 
  
  
// XOR Trick
   Suppose we insert 
   A1, A2, A3 in an array and then ask to xor everything with X1, X2, X3 one by one 
   Then it is the same as Xor-ing with X = XOR(x1, x2, x3).
   
   
// TO FIND THE ith Bit is set or not of integer 'n'
    int b=(n>>i)&1 
	
//RELATION B/W XOR , + , AND operations
    a+b=(a XOR b) + (a AND b)*2
