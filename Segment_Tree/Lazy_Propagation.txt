Let's be Lazy i.e., do work only when needed. How ? When we need to update an interval, we will update a node and mark its child that it needs to be updated and update it when needed.
 For this we need an array lazy[] of the same size as that of segment tree. Initially all the elements of the lazy[] array will be 0 representing that there is no pending update. 
If there is non-zero element lazy[k] then this element needs to update node k in the segment tree before making any query operation.

To update an interval we will keep 3 things in mind.

1) If current segment tree node has any pending update, then first add that pending update to current node.

2) If the interval represented by current node lies completely in the interval to update, then update the current node and update the lazy[] array for children nodes.

3) If the interval represented by current node overlaps with the interval to update, then update the nodes as the earlier update function

Since we have changed the update function to postpone the update operation, we will have to change the query function also. 
The only change we need to make is to check if there is any pending update operation on that node.
If there is a pending update operation, first update the node and then work same as the earlier query function.
